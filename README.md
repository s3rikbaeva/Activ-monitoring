<!-- GOAL OF THE PROJECT -->
## Goal of the project
Help developers discover the problem in time, evaluate it, give them the opportunity to suggest a solution, and avoid costly fixes without losing their way. As a result, the main goal is to develop the project in a <b>fixed time</b>, at a price and with a given <b>functionality</b> and <b>quality</b>.

We offer the following solutions:
* Correct calculation of time and effort for each project.
* Monitoring the performance of each employee of your company :speech_balloon:
* During the quarantine, many of the company's employees work from home, so our web app is up-to-date. :mask:
<br />

<!--IMPLEMENTATION  -->
## Implementation 
* Scope of the project: 3 months
* Type of the user-interface: Web-oriented application
1) User login/authorization
2) The ability for the user to fill in and send the form with the time spent, as well as calculate the remaining time.
3) The administrator should be able to see all employees and their working hours
<br />
